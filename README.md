## Project Description
The domain of the application is sports management. Our focus is on sports league management, and as a result our project will model the data involved in managing various teams and venues for a single season.

As a manager of the league, users would have access to all the logistical information related to every scheduled game. This includes the venue at which the games will be held, the teams involved, the tickets sold to that specific game, and information related to sponsors and ticket sales. 

The two classes of system users would be team managers and league managers. Team managers would have access to all the information associated with their specific team and their personnel, and league managers would be able to view the data of every single venue. There will be multiple venues and teams to keep track of, and the aim of the program is to enable managers to view their logistical information in an easy to use format. The database will enable league managers to compare and view data to all information regarding every team, venue and sponsorships. League managers have the ability to add and schedule games between teams. This could help them determine which teams require improvement or should be relocated. 

## Tech stack:
- DBMS: PostgreSQL
- Server side: Express
- Client side: React

We are using PostgreSQL as our database management system, Express for the server-side, and React for the client-side. This is a popular and effective tech stack for building web applications. There is a large and active JavaScript developer community that supports these technologies and we too have some experience working with this tech stack. We had to install some npm packages like pg (to connect our application with our DB), JWT (for authentication), and bootstrap (styling).
